        The NGO teaches children of Government school online. 
        It serves students of hundreds of schools across India. 
        Due to the Covid-19 pandemic most students lost almost two academic years. 
        Very students had access to online education. 
        The NGO is currently trying to bridge the gap by enabling volunteers to teach classes in addition to the curriculum taught by the school staff.

        I volunteered with and headed NSS NITK, an active social club in NITK.
        The primary focus of the club includes improving the living conditions of the underprivileged living in and around the University in Surathkal(near Mangalore, Karnataka).
        We provide books for the children, electric appliances for the families using funds collected from annual funding activities such as old newspaper collection and clothes collection.

        Another primary aim of the club is to raise awareness about and encourage students and faculty of NITK to participate in various social activities.
        We conduct college campus and NITK beach cleanup programmes and blood donation camps.
        We even perform street plays (nukkad natak) in and around the campus to raise awareness about pollution, water conservation etc.

        I led a bunch of enthusiastic students from NITK college to teach English language and Computer skills for the primary school kids of KREC Kannada Medium school.
        The materials required for teaching English is provided by Early Learning Center, Mangalore, Karnataka.
        This helped school children to prepare for their future in the competitive world. The team started with 15 volunteers in 2015 and the size of the team grew to 50 in 2018.
        In addition to teaching, we occasionally conduct programmes like sports day and teachers day for the kids.
