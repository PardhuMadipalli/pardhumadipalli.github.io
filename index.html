      </h2>
      <p class="">
        Working as a cloud full stack developer for more than 4 years.
        Over this time, I have worked on very diverse areas including web server technologies, cloud infrastructure and applications, and, UI.
        I've made contributions to several projects using technologies such as NodeJS, docker, and maven in my free time.
        I also have a very fair understanding of data science by working on multiple college projects.</p>
